# starting-project is a multiplatform game, made with using react native, which i created during course:
React Native - The Practical Guide [2023] by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.

The application is designed so that the player can type in any two-digit number, pass it on and have the application guess the value of the number we chose.
This is done by pressing plus or minus to tell the machine which way to look. 
The application on the final screen indicates how many rounds it took the app to guess the answer and, the number we passed on at the beginning. 
When you try to fool the application by pressing plus, even though it should be looking in the down value that is minus - you will get an alert not to cheat
